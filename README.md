# Be a Code Artist

I am 1yasa, a code artist who splashes creativity in the world of zeros and ones. Living in the AI era, I firmly believe that code is not just machine instructions, but also a bridge connecting people and the future. My passion lies in crafting delightful product experiences with elegant code.

The code I pursue is not a cold accumulation of logic, but a vibrant work of art. Variable names should be as precise as poetic verses, function designs as fluid as dances, and architectural structures as harmonious as paintings. I believe that only with an ultimate taste for code can we create truly touching products.

In my eyes, a good product is not just a collection of functions, but also a carrier of emotions. I am committed to integrating my pursuit of code taste into every detail of product design. From the smallest aspects of user interaction to the grand scale of system architecture, I strive for excellence. I believe that through the dual polishing of code and products, we can create AI-era products that are warmer, more humanized.
